            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><h3>1.0 Aims and Objectives</h3>

<p>The aims and objectives of the proposed programs are:</p>

<p>a) To adequately address both the academic and industry higher level of computing knowledge and skills needs within a single program, through the integration of the two areas of computing specializations, i.e. Computer Science and Information Systems.</p>

<p>b) To increase the critical mass of higher caliber computing professionals and potential computing academics in the country in line with global trends. Also, to train higher-level computing personnel with greater potential for productive computing academic career and professional practice, a cadre of personnel that is in great demand but in short supply locally, regionally, and globally.</p>

<p>c) To develop lecturers who will contribute to enquiry, development and synthesis of new knowledge in the theory and research of computing and academia. The students who are in this program will also develop internationally, regionally, and nationally recognized independent research that contributes to the frontier of knowledge in today’s fast growing technology. They will also demonstrate ability to present and defend research output to a critical audience.</p>

<h3>2.0 Rationale for the Program</h3>

<p>a) Botswana like many other countries is becoming more and more reliant on Information Technology in economic and social sectors. To keep up with the pressures or challenges of IT implementation and application the country needs to have skilled IT personnel. Maitlamo, Botswana’s National ICT Policy LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK &amp; CHANGE REPORT Final Report, December 2004 aims to make the country’s economy competitive by creating an enabling environment for the growth of the ICT industry in the country and making Botswana a Regional ICT Hub. Government initiatives such as the Botswana Innovation Hub are focused on creating an environment where businesses could be developed through research and de-velopment. The objectives of the National ICT policy will be realized with skilled local manpower up to the level of research in areas of ICT. One of the factors that would attract International Companies to the Innovation Hub is an educated local workforce. The proposed programs will produce skilled workforce that could drive ICT developments.</p>

<p>b) Local tertiary institutions are looking towards the University of Botswana to increase the high calibre staff strength in their establishments together with research outputs. The University of Botswana seeks to be a centre of excellence by moving from a teaching Institution to a research Institution therefore the situation necessitates the need of high calibre manpower to lead in the research. The local institutions are also interested in starting re-search projects as shown by the high enrolment number of their academic staff members in our Masters programs.</p>

<p>c) The statistical analyses have been carried out in all three ways. These are: on-line access to the university websites, through personal contacts by getting there, and the data-survey done through an advertisement to fill the vacancy in the department. Based on them and the feedback taken from the honorable members of the advisory board, it was found that there were a very few MPhil/PhD programs running in Computer Science or Computer Information Systems being in the SADC region. Existing programs in the region and internationally are not easily accessible to local students due to a number of factors including high tuition fees, family and social commitments. The University of Botswana is in a better position to fill this gap and produce research graduates for its consumption as well as for other international institutions and industry through the proposed programs.</p>

<h3>3.0 Career Opportunities</h3>

<p>These programs will produce professionals at senior levels of operations, administration, management, design &amp; planning and are expected to fill gaps in high demand areas such as computer auditing project management etc.</p>

<p>Career opportunities for computer scientists are, therefore, plentiful and varied at senior to very senior level besides the academic ones. In fact, a competent Computer Scientist is employable in many positions that are traditionally associated with Computer Science. These include but are not limited to: Computer Programmer or Analyst; Applications Programmer; Software Engineer; Network Administrator; Database Administrator; Computer Systems Consultant; Information Systems Manager; Operations Manager; Technical Consultant; Systems Analyst; Systems Development Manager; Project Manager, Sales and End-user Technical Support Manager or Consultant, Computer Science Academic or Researcher.</p>

<h3>4.0 Departmental Regulations for MPhil/PhD Degree Programmes in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems</h3>
