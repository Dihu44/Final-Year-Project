<p>The Graduate Level courses in the Department of Statistics will be guided by the following Departmental Special Regulations:</p>

<h3>1.2 Coursework</h3>

<p>1.2.1 Unless otherwise stated, each course is normally 3 credits.</p>

<p>1.2.2 The Project Report (STA 691) is a no taught one semester course, where the student does a project under a supervisor from the Department. The topic shall be finalised at the start of the semester. There will be no formal final examination. The course shall be assessed by 2 research exercises and a project report. The 2 research exercises shall constitute 40 per cent and the project report shall constitute 60 per cent of the final marks. The project report shall be submitted before the last day of the semester. However, a request for a one-month extension may be allowed by the Head of the Department under special circumstances, if so recommended by the supervisor. This course is open to PGD Statistics students only.</p>

<p>1.2.3 For Advanced Statistical Computing (STA 671) the final examination will be a practical exam of 4 hours and the final assessment grade will be based on the continuous assessment and the examination in the ratio 1:1.</p>

<p>1.2.4 The Statistical Consultancy (STA 681) course is centred around consultancy projects which are assigned in the first 2 weeks of the semester. Some informal lectures accompany these projects to explain specific technicalities. The final grade is based on 3 minor projects and a major project. The minor projects shall account for 50 per cent of the final mark and the major project will account for 50 per cent of the final mark. There will be no formal final examination.</p>

<p>1.2.5 In the Selected Special Topics (STA 783) course, the student undertakes up to date reviews of 2 or 3 statistical techniques. Assessment is based on the review reports on the techniques selected, a presentation of at least one of the reports at a Departmental seminar, and a 3-hour open-book examination on the journal articles chosen for the report. The report presentation and the examination carry equal weight for the final grade.</p>

<p>1.2.6 The Research Treatise (STA 790) shall be taken over a period of 2 semesters totalling 6credits; the student will work under a supervisor. The student is expected to demonstrate the ability to master and critically analyse a prescribed area of advanced statistical literature by making 2 presentations and finally presenting a Research Treatise Report. At the end of STA 791 the student should have made the first presentation and the second presentation will be at the end of STA 792. The last date of submission of the Report shall be the last day of lectures of the second semester. In exceptional cases, it may be ex-tended by not more than 2 months, if a request is made through the Head of the Department, supported by the supervisor, at least 2 weeks before the due date. The length of the report shall be around 60 typed, A4 pages (1.5 line spacing). The report will be internally evaluated and will further be externalised. The final assessment grade for the course will be based on the 2 presentations (20 per cent) and the report (80 per cent).</p>

<h3>1.3 Examinations and Assessment</h3>

<p>The written examination for all courses, unless otherwise specified in the course template, will normally be of 3 hours’ duration. The continuous assessment and the examination shall be weighted in the ratio of 1:1. The cumulative GPA shall be computed in accordance with General Academic Regulation 00.86.</p>
