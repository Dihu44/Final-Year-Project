            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><h3>Background</h3>

<p>China is one of the most dynamic countries in the world today. In recent decades its role in world affairs has grown tremendously. For Botswana, and for Africa as a whole, China has become a major partner in terms of diplomacy, trade, investment, tourism, aid etc. Relations are expanding rapidly in many sectors, involving companies and members of the public as well as governments.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the degree programme</h3>

<p>The Chinese Studies Programme at the University of Botswana aims to produce graduates who are proficient in the Chinese language and at home in the Chinese cultural environment. The Programme was launched in 2011. It is unique in the region because it it is interdisciplinary in nature: our courses cover an array of aspects, ranging from the study of Mandarin Chinese to the rich history and philosophy of Traditional China to the thriving economy and foreign relations of today’s China. The knowledge, skills and attitudes that our graduates acquire enable them to interact adeptly with the economy and society of China. They can thus make a unique contribution to Botswana’s and Africa’s growing relations with the world’s foremost emerging power.</p>

<h3>Expected outcomes</h3>

<p>Students pursuing the major in Chinese Studies will have acquired a proficiency in Mandarin Chinese that is at least equivalent to Level 4 of the International Chinese Proficiency Test Hanyu Shiuping Kaoshi (HSK) by the time they finish Level 400. This means that they are fluent for practical purposes and able to translate correctly and appropriately both ways.</p>

<p>Chinese Studies graduates typically possess excellent intercultural competence skills. This is the ability to interact appropriately and efficiently with people from different cultural backgrounds, a skill that is increasingly favoured by employers in today’s competitive local, regional and global market place.</p>

<p>Other key skills that our graduates will have developed are communication skills, critical thinking skills, analytical skills, the ability to work in a team, public speaking skills, time management etc.</p>

<h3>Entrance requirements</h3>

<p>Eligibility for admission to the programme is in accordance with the General Academic Regulations of the University of Botswana and the Special Regulations of the Faculty of Humanities. The Faculty has discretion to admit students who do not fully meet these requirements but who have prior qualifications in Mandarin Chinese.</p>

<h3>Career prospects</h3>

<p>Graduates with a qualification in Chinese Studies can find employment opportunities in sectors such as:</p>

<ul><li>international trade</li>
	<li>banking</li>
	<li>diplomacy and international organizations</li>
	<li>the civil service</li>
	<li>tourism</li>
	<li>education</li>
</ul><h3>Structure of the degree programme</h3>

<p>Chinese Studies is offered as a single major at the University of Botswana. The single major is a concentrated four-year programme leading to a degree of Bachelor of Arts in Chinese Studies. Students take a well-rounded series of core courses in Mandarin Chinese and on various aspects of China. Apart from these subject-specific core courses, students also take courses in key professional competences such as computer skills and communication skills. Finally, students take a specified number of optional courses from other subjects within the University. An extensive list of potential options is provided for students to choose from according to their personal interests and professional goals.</p>

<ol><li>The Chinese Studies programme offers a concentrated Single Major leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree. This concentration is necessary in view of the high language standard to be mastered in four (4) years.</li>
	<li>To successfully complete the Programme, students will be required to obtain 125 credits, of which 60 will be from core language courses, 30 from core non-language courses, 7 from an attachment or project, 9 from core courses in a stream (language or non-language) chosen in Level 400, 9 from options and 10 from GEC courses.</li>
	<li>It should be noted that due to the special nature of this Programme, the majority of the Chinese Studies courses are core.</li>
	<li>Teaching will continue to be in English for language courses at lower levels and for non-language courses. This is in accordance with international best practice and is necessary because of the relative difficulty of beginning Chinese.</li>
	<li>In Level 300, students can spend either a full year or a semester in China at a partner institution. Students who are unable to embark on the immersion programme will take the Level 300 courses presented in the University Calendar..</li>
	<li>In Level 400 students will choose a stream (language or non-language) according to their personal interests. Students will take core courses according to their chosen stream.</li>

<h5>CHN 102 Basic Mandarin 2</h5>

<h5>CHN 104 Understanding China</h5>

<p>This course provides an in-depth survey of aspects of Chinese society and culture. It builds on the knowledge that students have acquired in CHN 103 but aims to be more analytical and reflective. The course takes an interdisciplinary approach and provides a further foundation for the continued study of traditional and contemporary China.</p>

<h5>CHN 105 Basic Practical Mandarin 1</h5>

<p>This is a practical beginner’s course in Mandarin Chinese with a focus on basic listening comprehension and oral skills. Starting with pinyin, students will gradually build up their communicative competency in Chinese.

This practical twelve (12) credit course is suitable for students from a non-Chinese Studies background to take as an elective.</p>

<h5>CHN 106 Basic Practical Mandarin 2</h5>

<h5>CHN 203 Ancient and Imperial History of China (to 1911)</h5>

<p>The course examines the ancient history of China from its prehistoric/ legendary starting point to the establishment of the Chinese Imperial system. It then looks at the imperial period from both a chronological and thematic perspective. Finally it examines Imperial China’s nineteenth century decline, including foreign aggression, internal resistance and failed attempts to modernize.</p>

<h5>CHN 204 Modern History of China (since 1911)</h5>

<p>China had a tumultuous history in the twentieth century, including revolution, civil war, foreign invasion, and political extremism. In order to understand China’s present-day society and public affairs it is necessary to understand this background. This course begins with the 1911 Revolution that ended the Empire. It then covers the Republican era, the triumph of the Communist Party in 1949 and the first decades of the People’s Republic ending with Deng Xiaoping’s policy of Opening Up and Reform.</p>

<h5>CHN 205 Chinese Philosophy and Religion</h5>

<p>The course introduces issues, developments and debates of Chinese thought. It explores key concepts, such as the Tao, Heaven and qi. The course reviews in detail the crucial period of the “Hundred Schools” in which the main Chinese traditions, including that of Confucius, were established and explores how these traditions evolved later on. The course also covers the introduction of Buddhism to China, its acceptance and acquisition of distinctively Chinese features.</p>

<h5>CHN 206 Political Economy of Contemporary China</h5>

<h5>CHN 210 Introduction to Classical Chinese</h5>

<p>This optional course aims to introduce students to Classical Chinese, the language in which China’s ancient philosophical texts were written. This language also formed the foundation of the literary language of China that was in use until the early twentieth century. Students will be introduced to the basic syntax, grammar, and vocabulary of Classical Chinese, including through reading text fragments in the original wherever possible such as short proverbs and philosophical writings.</p>

<h5>CHN 311 Intermediate Mandarin Chinese Reading and Writing 1</h5>

<h5>CHN 310 Attachment / Project</h5>

<p>This course will run during the winter session, i.e., the long vacation from May to July. Students will carry out a supervised and assessed research project or attachment related to Botswana-China relations. The research project involves structured reading, field research and writing on a topic agreed upon by the student and a supervisor and approved by the lecturer responsible for the unit. Students are expected to employ the skills and conceptual knowledge acquired in earlier courses to investigate an appropriate issue or topic in Botswana-China or Africa-China relations. The attachment involves the external placement of a student with a professional or other kind of body in order to gain relevant first-hand experience in the field of Chinese Studies. The period of attachment should be at least six weeks. Members of staff visit the students and meet their supervisors to gather feedback on the attachment.</p>

<h5>CHN 309 Approaches and Methods in Chinese Studies</h5>

<p>The course is intended to introduce basic concepts, approaches and methods of research and insights into the strengths and weaknesses of an area study-based approach to the study of China versus discipline-based approaches. Students will read and discuss sample research papers to explore different research methodologies and conceptual and theoretical frameworks applied in Chinese Studies research. Through this course students should get a better understanding of the scope of Chinese studies and the approaches and methods used in various fields of research.</p>

<h5>CHN 313 Africa-China Relations</h5>

<p>The aim of this course is to critically explore the changing economic, political and people-to-people relations between Africa and China. The course covers Africa-China relations in the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial era, but the main focus is on the past two decades of rapidly changing relations between Africa and China.</p>
