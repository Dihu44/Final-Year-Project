            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><h2>Background</h2>

<p>The new Faculty of Medicine (FOM) at the University of Botswana (UB) offers both undergraduate (MBBS) and postgraduate degrees (MMed). The following 4 year long postgraduate training programmes (start in January) are available:</p>

<ul><li>Anaesthesia &amp; Critical Care (Princess Marina and South African academic hospitals</li>
	<li>Emergency Medicine (Princess Marina and University of Cape Town academic hospitals</li>
	<li>Family Medicine (Mahalapye District Hospital, Letsholathebe II Memorial Hospital, Maun)</li>
	<li>Internal Medicine (Princess Marina and University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch Univ academic hospitals</li>
	<li>Paediatrics and Adolescent Health (Princess Marina and Univ of Witwatersrand academic hospitals)</li>
	<li>Public Health Medicine (based in Gaborone with district rotations)</li>
	<li>Pathology (Anatomical and Clinical) UB, National Health Lab and South African academic hospitals</li>
</ul><h2>Transfers</h2>

<p>Any Motswana who started postgraduate training elsewhere and for whatever reason has not been able to complete a programme and still wants to pursue their studies, may be eligible to transfer into UB programmes for the above specialties on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>The Positions</h2>

<p>MMed trainees will be in fulltime training though working in MOH facilities. Those on sponsorship from the government will receive compensation packages consistent with government policies and previous experience. Applicants not on Government sponsorship will have to arrange their own sponsorship to cover UB fees, books and related items, travel and living expenses.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>All applicants should have completed medical training at a recognized school of medicine and have been in active clinical practice for at least two years – one or more of which must have been in an approved internship programme. Whilst preference will be given to Botswana citizens, non-citizens with proof of sponsorship will be considered as well. It’s the responsibility of the applicant to ensure they fulfill criteria for sponsorship by their prospective sponsor before applying.</p>

<h2>Application Procedures</h2>

<p>Completed applications must include:</p>

<p>a. An up-to-date curriculum vitae listing education, work experience and relevant personal information.</p>

<p>b. A statement of approximately 500 words indicating why the applicant is seeking postgraduate training in the particular specialty.</p>

<p>c. Certified copies of qualifications and degrees as well as official transcripts from the applicant’s medical school.</p>

<p>d. Three letters of reference from professional contacts.</p>

<p>e. Completed School of Graduate Studies application from.</p>

<h2>Regulations</h2>

<p>The Master of Medicine is offered as a medical post-graduate programme involving clinical rotations, course work and dissertation. Trainees will be working full time in health establishments and undertaking training as an integral part of their clinical workload.</p>

<h3>1.0 Special Regulations</h3>

<p>Subject to the provisions of the General Regulations 00, 40 and 41, the following Faculty of Medicine (FOM) regulations shall apply.</p>

<h3>2.0 Degree Programme</h3>

<p>All who successfully complete these programmes will be awarded an MMed degree from the University of Botswana and will qualify for specialty registration with the Botswana Health Professions Council.</p>

<h3>3.0 Entrance and Residential Requirements</h3>

<p>3.1 Applicants must hold a first degree in Medicine or equivalent from recognized University and must have completed at least two years of clinical practice that must include at least 12 months in a recognized supervised internship programme.</p>

<p>3.2 Completed applications shall be received by the deadline set by the SOM immediately preceding the commencement of the academic year for which the application is made.</p>

<p>3.3 Applicants meeting basic entry requirements will be invited for an interview. Selection will be based on the candidate’s competitiveness including the interview outcome. The overall assessment will be 30% for academic qualifications, 30% for relevant experience including supportive references and 40% for the interview.</p>

<p>3.4 The graduate student will commence her/his M. Med Programme on the date specified in the offer letter.</p>

<p>3.5 The applicants will be required to start as a class on pre-set dates. An applicant unable to take up her/his admission may however resubmit her/his application in subsequent years.</p>

<p>3.6 A student may withdraw from studies by requesting permission to withdraw from the Department and the SGS. When such a request is approved by the Department and the SGS the student’s registration may be suspended for up to 24 months [4 semesters].</p>

<h3>4.0 Programme Structure</h3>

<p>4.1 The specialised M. Med. Areas share a common format.</p>

<p>4.2 Each requires four years of full time study which is consistent with SADC and other international standards. Candidates will complete eight semesters of Level 600 and 700 courses.</p>

<p>4.3 A dissertation is required.</p>

<h3>5.0 Progression and Research Requirements</h3>

<p>5.1 Progress toward the M. Med. degree will be made through a balanced programme of study including didactic seminar instruction and supervised clinical apprenticeships in the specialty area of choice.</p>

<p>5.2 As an integrating capstone to this continuous learning process each student must write and defend a research-based dissertation. It is expected that the initial effort for this dissertation will begin early in the learner’s career at UB and no later than the second semester courses GME 602 and 701; Introduction to Clinical Research &amp; Introduction to Medical Literature respectively. Formal submission and examination of this work will occur at some point during the last two years of the M. Med programme. Academic credit structure to support the dissertation research may vary from specialty to specialty.</p>

<p>5.3 Students are generally required to progress through all the courses of the programme in sequence. However, in the early years of the programme there may be exceptional applicants who have completed one or more years of post-graduate training in other countries. Such candidates may apply to the Dean of FOM for special consideration in accordance with UB policy on prior learning.</p>

<p>5.4 Training shall be based on a tutorial and interactive learning model.</p>

<p>5.5 Supervision from clinical staff members shall be provided at different levels depending on the progress of the student and the difficulty or risk involved with the service/ procedure.</p>

<p>5.6 By the end of the programme all trainees will be expected to function independently in the vast majority of clinical situations to be encountered by the average practitioner in their disciplines.</p>

<p>5.7 While the seminar-based subject material can in general be well defined and presented in an orderly progression, the learning process for the clinical base is less structured and predictable. Patients arrive, are cared for, and provide unique learning opportunities at different times and in different settings. Competency is, of course, measured and reported during the entire learning experience, but each learner’s sequential progress is different depending on the presentation of clinical material to the wards and clinics. This is a distinguishing feature of postgraduate medical education and it requires a very close interactive relationship between learner and mentor(s) throughout the training programme.</p>

<p>5.8 In the end the faculty is obliged to confirm that all learners have reached competency levels in all relevant areas of the chosen specialty but the integration of the individual patient based learning experiences will be different for each candidate.</p>

<p>5.9 Students who demonstrate conduct appropriate to the profession of medicine throughout the four years duration of the programme and successfully complete all the academic requirements of the programme will be eligible to graduate with a Master of Medicine degree.</p>

<h3>7.0 Conduct of students</h3>

<p>7.1 Any conduct deemed inappropriate to the profession of medicine will be referred to the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in writing. If these allegations are of a serious nature, the Dean may convene a Disciplinary Committee to investigate the allegations and to determine any actions to be taken. The allegations may be dismissed, or the student may be given a written warning, placed on probation or dismissed after consultation with the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies and the DVCAA. Any student who appears before the disciplinary committee more than once for allegations of a serious nature which are proved to be true is likely to be dismissed.</p>

<p>7.2 The opinion of the BHPC will be sought in cases of serious professional misconduct.</p>

<h3>8.0 Performance Evaluation</h3>

<p>8.1 Rotations Evaluations</p>

<p>8.1.1 The resident’s performance will be evaluated by the specialist/lecturer. A written evaluation will be completed at least once per rotation.</p>

<p>8.1.2 The record of evaluations of the residents will be maintained by the Faculty of Medicine. These written reports, completed on the evaluation form, will be kept in the resident’s personal file. Residents will review their file any time he or she wishes.</p>

<p>8.1.3 Evaluations assess procedural skills, fund of medical knowledge, medical management ability, patient communication and relationship skills, acceptance of supervision, work ethic, patient-centred focus, understanding and application of socioeconomic principles, and medical record completion.</p>

<p>8.1.4 Verbal feedback will be given to the resident regarding the evaluation by the faculty.</p>

<p>8.1.5 The resident will be given a grade of P (progress), U (unsatisfactory) or I (incomplete) for each rotation.</p>

<p>8.1.6 The Faculty members of the relevant Specialty will review residents’ progress regularly.</p>

<p>8.1.7 The relevant Specialty Faculty members will meet the residents at regular intervals (at least quarterly), to evaluate their performance, give them feedback and listen to their concerns.</p>

<h3>9.0 Attendance at formal teaching sessions:</h3>

<p>Attendance is expected at all teaching sessions, unless in case of unavoidable clinical responsibilities, sickness or personal emergency, subject to approval by the Head of Department. Mandatory minimum attendance requirement of 80%.</p>

<h4>9.1 Unsatisfactory Evaluations</h4>

<p>9.1.1 Those residents who do not receive a satisfactory grade for a rotation will be allowed to repeat that rotation once without penalty.</p>

<p>9.1.2 A second poor showing will result in the resident being placed on probation which will include specific requirements which must be met before it can be lifted.</p>

<p>9.1.3 A resident who remains on probation for more than 6 months is liable to termination from the programme</p>

<h4>9.2 Dissertation and Examinations</h4>

<p>Candidates who have successfully completed Part 1 exam, dissertation, Part II exam and the rotations, shall be recommended by the FOM to Senate for award of the MMed degree of the University of Botswana</p>

<p>9.2.1 Residents shall be required to have a dissertation accepted by the examiners as well as pass Part I and Part II examinations prior to receipt of the MMed degree. The examinations shall be of similar standard as that of the College of Medicine of South Africa or similar international professional body for the respective specialties/disciplines. Where possible, desirable and advantageous, disciplines may use the South African College examinations which shall be accepted by the UB as equivalent to its own examinations and for purposes of meeting the academic requirements of the MMed programme.</p>

<p>9.2.2 Dissertation</p>

<p>9.2.2.1 Residents will be required to take a course on clinical research and medical literature within the first two years as a prerequisite for their dissertation</p>

<p>9.2.2.2 Each resident will select their dissertation topic and supervisor by end of the first year. The resident will, with the assistance of the supervisor, develop an acceptable programme of the research project culminating in the submission and examination of the proposal by the seventh semester.</p>

<p>9.2.2.3 The dissertation will have to be 2500 to 10 000 words (excluding footnotes, tables and appendices) and found to be of adequate standard by the examiners.</p>

<p>9.2.2.4 Examination of the Dissertation shall be in accordance with the UB regulations [41.11] and shall be assessed as follows:</p>

<p>a. Accepted and passed;</p>

<p>b. Accepted pending minor modifications;</p>

<p>c. Referred for major amendments; or</p>

<p>d. Failed</p>

<p>The completion of required minor amendments to the Dissertation shall be coordinated by the Supervisor and certified by the Internal Examiner [41.11.5]. Major amendments shall be approved by the External Examiner [41.11.6].</p>

<p>9.2.3 The M. Med Part I examination must be passed by the resident within the first two years of the MMed programme. Satisfactory evaluations of both the Rotations and by the relevant faculty members shall be a prerequisite for taking the M. Med Part I examination. Residents will be given a pass or fail grade for the MMed Part 1 examination.</p>

<p>9.2.3.1 A candidate who fails the MMed Part 1 exam shall be allowed to re-sit the Part I exam the following semester.</p>

<p>9.2.3.2 The Part I exam will be available once every semester. Therefore within the first two years of the M Med programme there will be a maximum of four potential opportunities for the resident to sit the exam.</p>

<p>9.2.3.3 A candidate who does not pass the MMed Part I exam within the first two years of the MMed shall have their future with the MMed programme reviewed by the Faculty of Medicine Board, with strong consideration given to the recommendation by the relevant supervising department.</p>

<p>9.2.3.4 If the Board decides that the candidate has otherwise performed well during their MMed and is worthy of further opportunities to pass the Part 1 exam, the candidate may remain in the M Med programme and re-sit the exam. Such a candidate will re-register for the MMed Part 1 examination preparation course and continue the clinical rotations of the fourth semester in Botswana. Once the candidate has successfully passed the part 1 exam they may commence third year (semester five) of the MMed programme.</p>

<p>9.2.3.5 If the Faculty of Medicine Board decides that the candidates overall performance during the M Med programme has been unsatisfactory, the Faculty of Medicine Board may decide to terminate the candidate’s place in the M Med programme. A candidate shall commence rotations at external collaborating institutions only after successfully passing the Part-I M. Med examination and completing at least two years of the programme in Botswana.</p>

<p>9.2.3.6 This section on examinations may not apply to all programmes. Please refer to the section on each programme for specifics on examinations.</p>

<p>9.2.4 The MMed Part II examination will take place during fourth year of the MMed programme, and the candidates will be examined according to the training received. Satisfactory evaluations of the Rotations by the relevant faculty members shall be a prerequisite for taking the M. Med Part II examination. The Part II examination may be taken before or after acceptance of the dissertation, but the resident has to have successfully completed the dissertation and passed the Part II examination in order to be recommended by the Faculty Board to the Senate for conferment of an MMed degree. Individual MMed programmes may set additional pre-requisites for the sitting of the Part II examination, e.g., the submission of case logs or performance portfolios. Residents will receive a pass or fail grade for the M Med part II examination.</p>

<p>9.2.4.1 A candidate who fails the M Med Part II exam shall, with the permission of the Faculty of Medicine Board be allowed to re-sit the exam the following semester.</p>

<p>9.2.4.2 Further attempts at the Part II exam may be possible, with the permission of the Faculty of Medicine Board, providing the resident does not exceed the overall maximum duration of the M. Med programme.</p>

<p>9.2.4.3 The maximum duration of the MMed training programme is 6 years. Therefore a candidate who fails to pass the Part II exam within 6 years of commencing the MMed shall, with the permission of the Faculty of Medicine Board be discontinued from the programme.</p>

<p>9.2.4.4 It is the responsibility of the resident to ensure that they have the requisite funding to cover training and welfare expenses during their time at UB. Where a resident’s training goes beyond 4 years, they have to secure additional sponsorship to sustain them during this time as well.</p>

<h3>10.0 Leave</h3>

<p>10.1 Residents will be entitled to twenty (20) working days of leave per year, that must (except for extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances) be approved in writing at least four months in advance by the relevant University of Botswana Head of Departments. Leave approval must be granted by both the Head of Department of the residents Specialty, as well as the Supervising Clinician in whichever clinical rotation the resident is undertaking at the time of the leave. Leave cannot accumulate from one year to the next.</p>

<p>10.2 Residents will be entitled to ten (10) working days of conference/skills development/remedial work or similar extracurricular academic activities per year. Attendance at mandatory courses, examinations, etc. is NOT considered as study leave, as it is part of the study course. However, attendance at conferences will be considered study leave. Study leave must (except for extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances) be approved in writing at least four months in advance by the relevant University of Botswana Head of Departments. Leave approval must be granted by both the Head of Department of the residents Specialty, as well as the Supervising Clinician in whichever clinical rotation the resident is undertaking at the time of the leave. Leave cannot accumulate from one year to the next.</p>

<p>10.3</p>

<ul><li>Unauthorized absences will be counted as annual leave, or study leave if no annual leave remaining. If no annual leave or study leave remaining, absenteeism must be made up for by working an extra shift.</li>
	<li>If there are concerns regarding persistent absenteeism, these concerns must be discussed with the trainee, and documented and placed in their file.</li>
	<li>Maternity leave, sick leave and so on will be granted according to Botswana Law. Time for maternity or any such extenuating circumstances shall be excluded in calculating the total duration that a resident has spent in the MMed Programme. Absence of one week or more because of sick leave: this time must be made up, in order to ensure residents have adequate exposure and education from the rotation. Study leave can be used to make up this extra time.</li>

	<li>The format shall be a mixture of essay questions to demonstrate integrative skills and short answer questions. A candidate will be required to answer all questions.</li>
	<li>A 3-hour closed book practical examination with a subminimum of 50%. The format shall be: Answer all questions.</li>
	<li>An H &amp; E stained section from 15 different histo-pathological cases (including surgical or autopsy cases) to be described and a diagnosis (or differential diagnosis) exhibited, with mention of any appropriate ancillary investigations that may be required for the diagnosis.</li>
	<li>The slides will comprise medical and surgical pathology and each slide will diagnosable at a morphological level. No dual pathologies will be included. Cytopathology will not be included. No more than three cases may be diagnosed incorrectly.</li>
</ul><p>11.7.6 Part-II M. Med Examination</p>

<p>A candidate will be admitted to the part II examination after completing 42 months in full-time post internship training as an Anatomical pathology Registrar in an accredited anatomical Pathology teaching laboratory at the time of applying for the examination. The candidate must have successfully completed part I. The candidate must have completed at least 6 months full time in an approved cytology laboratory. This may form part of the 42 months training in anatomical pathology. The candidate will be required to submit a certificate from the Head of the department(s) where he/she has been working showing that he/she has properly completed a minimum of 50 autopsies satisfactorily under supervision and is able to cut and stained frozen sections. A portfolio of training must be submitted for assessment to confirm that the above have been adequately and satisfactorily completed.</p>

<p>11.7.6.1 Conduct of the examination</p>

<p>The part II examination with overall pass mark of 50% shall comprise:</p>

<p>ii. The format shall be:</p>

<p>iii. Answer all questions comprising a mixture of essay questions to demonstrate integrative skills and short answer questions divided into molecular pathology; principles of pathology and special techniques including electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and special investigations and laboratory management as well as ethical considerations. The practice of surgical pathology and cytopathology will also be part of this examination.</p>

<p>iv. A series of practical examinations each with a subminimum of 50% (unless otherwise stated) comprising:</p>

<ul><li>An autopsy examination with a time-limit of 3 hours.</li>
</ul><p>The format will include:</p>

<ul><li>Scrutiny of the clinical file(s)</li>
	<li>External examination of the body</li>
	<li>Appropriate dissection</li>
	<li>Presentation of the findings with a clinico-pathological correlation and a provisional anatomical diagnosis</li>
	<li>Performance of frozen section or smear if necessary.</li>
</ul><p>v. Two three-hour closed book practical examination each with a subminimum of 50%.</p>

<p>The format shall be as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Answer all questions</li>
	<li>The first practical consists of an H &amp; E-stained sections from each of 15 different histopathological cases to be described and a diagnosis or differential diagnosis exhibited with mention of any appropriate ancillary investigations that may be required for the diagnosis.</li>
	<li>The second practical consists of appropriately stained exfoliative or aspiration smears from 15 different cases to be described and a diagnosis or differential diagnosis exhibited with mention of appropriate ancillary investigations that may be required for the diagnosis. Not more than 3 cases may be diagnosed incorrectly in either examination.</li>
	<li>The basic tenet is that the pass in each slide and the examination overall should be that the candidate must demonstrate the ability to practice surgical and cytopathology safely at a generalist level.</li>
</ul><p>vi. Two closed book OSPE examination of up to three hours duration each with a subminimum 0f 50% (except for certain inter-active components).</p>

	<li>A one-hour session including H &amp; E slides with electron photomicrographs and radiological images of bone biopsies.</li>
</ul><p>Examination 2 will include:</p>

<ul><li>A 30-minute interactive session with 10frozen section slides to diagnose</li>
	<li>A 30-minute interactive session with brain smears</li>
	<li>A 1-hour session with renal biopsies and appropriate special stains and/or electron micrographs for interpretation</li>
	<li>A 1-hour session including muscle and nerve biopsy and liver biopsies for interpretation with relevant special stains including electron microscopy as indicated.</li>
